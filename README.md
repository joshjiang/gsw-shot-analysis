Abstract
--
The Golden State Warriors (GSW) have demonstrated striking dominance in recent years of the National Basketball Association. Making every final of the last 4 years and breaking the record for best regular season, they have proved their performance. With such a powerful record, many other teams struggle to find effective strategies against them. As a result, a more technical analysis of GSWâ€™s play offers meaningful insight as to what an ideal strategy would look like. In this article, we propose a K-Means clustering analysis of shots taken and successfully made. This approach takes advantage of the unique graphical representation of K-Means while, at the same time, creates a statistically significant gameplan on the court. Through the visual representation of K-Means Clustering, teams are able to generate effective strategies to make effective moves. We present NBA Shot Percentage Analysis using K-Means Clustering in hopes of addressing the monopolization of National titles within recent years
